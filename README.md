# Password Manager
Password Manager for Debian lets you securely access your passwords so you can easily access your account.

## Installation

Download the installer here: [Password Manager.tar.gz](https://github.com/GabeCoder/password-manager/files/6406465/Password.Manager.tar.gz)

## Usage

To run this app, click Menu > Accessories > Password Manager.

To add passwords, click on "Add Password". You'll be prompted to enter a username for the password and a password for the username. To browse the passwords, click on 'Browse Passwords", and you'll get a pair of options for each password. The passwords are hidden as default to prevent accidental leakage from possible streaming. You can reveal and delete passwords.
